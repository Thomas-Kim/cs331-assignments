\begin{problem}
  {Q3(a)}
  Give an algorithm to find the minimum-product spanning tree.
  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
    \STATE Let $G(V,E)$ be the graph in question
    \FOR {$\forall e \in E$}
    \STATE $weight(e) = ln(weight(e))$
    \ENDFOR
    \STATE Run Prim's algorithm on the new graph $G'$
  \end{algorithmic}
  \textbf{Proof of correctness}
  \begin{proof}
    Note that by the problem, $w > 1$ \\
    Restricting the domain to $(1, \infty), ln(x)$ is one-to-one and monotonically increasing \\
    $ln(\prod_{i = 1}^{n}w_i) = \sum_{i = 1}^{n}ln(w_i)$ \\
    So the sum of the modified weights is equal to the natural log of the product-weight. \\
    Since $ln(x)$ is one-to-one and monotonically increasing for the domain of this problem, minimizing $\sum_{i = 1}^{n}ln(w_i)$ will minimize $\prod_{i = 1}^{n}w_i$ \\
  \end{proof}
  The time taken to change the weights of each edge is $O(m)$. \\
  The time taken to run Prim's algorithm is $O(mlog(n))$. \\
  Therefore, the total runtime is $O(mlog(n) + m) = O(mlog(n))$. \\
\end{problem}
