\begin{problem}
  {Q3(b)}
  Prove that if the weights of an undirected graph are unique, there exists a unique minimum spanning tree.
  \begin{proof}
    Suppose two MSTs $T_1, T_2$ differ by some edge $e$. \\
    Suppose $e \in T_1 \land e \not\in T_2$. \\
    Take $T' = T_2 \cup \{e\}$ \\
    Note that $T'$ must contain a cycle, since $T'$ is a spanning tree and $e$ is a non-tree edge. \\
    $T_2$ must contain some edge $e'$, such that $e'$ and $e$ are in the same cycle in $T'$ and $w(e) < w(e')$. \\
    Replace $e'$ with $e$ in $T_2$. This creates a new tree with a smaller cost than $T_2$. \\
    This means $T_2$ is not an MST. \\
  \end{proof}
