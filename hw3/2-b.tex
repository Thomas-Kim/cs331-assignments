\begin{problem}
  {Q2(b)}
  Given a set of 4-tuples $(s_i, d_i, p_i, q_i)$, where each entry corresponds to source, destination, departure time, arrival time respectively, calculate
  the plan that arrives at $d_i$ as early as possible, while allowing for at least $1$ hour for each connecting flight. \\
  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
    \STATE Let $G(V,E)$ be an empty graph
    \FOR {$\forall (s_i, d_i, p_i, q_i)$}
    \STATE Construct a vertex corresponding to the departure gate in $s_i,$ $d_{s_i}$
    \STATE Construct a vertex corresponding to the arrival gate in $d_i,$ $a_{d_i}$
    \STATE Construct a vertex corresponding to the departure gate in $d_i,$ $d_{d_i}$
    \STATE Create a directed edge $e = (d_{s_i}, a_{d_i})$ with weight $q_i - p_i$
    \ENDFOR
  \end{algorithmic}
