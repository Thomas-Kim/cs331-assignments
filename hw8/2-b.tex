  {Q2(b): 13.11(b)}
  Suppose that machines are not able to queue up excess jobs, so if the random assignment of jobs to machines sends more than one jobs to a machine
  $M$, then $M$ will do the first of the jobs it receives and reject the rest. Let $R(k)$ be the expected number of rejected jobs; so $\frac{R(k)}{k}$
  is the expected fraction of rejected jobs. What is $lim_{k \rightarrow \infty}\frac{R(k)}{k}$? Give a proof of your answer.
