\begin{problem}
  {Q3(a): 8.1(a)}
  For each of the two questions below, decide whether the answer is "Yes," "No," or "Unknown, because it would resolve $\mathcal{P} = \mathcal{NP}$"
  Give a brief explanation of your answer.
  Let's define the decision version of the interval scheduling problem from chapter 4 as follows: Given a collection of intervals on a time-line, and
  a bound $k$, does the collection contain a subset of nonoverlapping intervals of size at least $k$?
  Question: Is it the case that Interval Scheduling $\leq_{p}$ Vertex Cover?
