  {Q2(c): 13.11(c)}
  Now assume that machines have slightly larger buffers; each machine $M$ will do the first two jobs it receives, and reject any additional jobs. Let
  $R_k(k)$ denote the expected number of rejected jobs under this rule. What is $lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} \frac{R_2(k)}{k}$? Give a proof of your
  answer.
