\begin{problem}
  {Q3(b): 8.1(b)}
  Question: Is it the case that Independent Set $\leq_{p}$ Interval Scheduling?
  \textbf{Unknown}
  Independent Set is NP-complete. If Independent Set $\leq_{p}$ Interval Scheduling, there would exist a polynomial algorithm to decide
  Independent Set, which by extension would mean there exists a polynomial-time algorithm to solve all NP problems.
