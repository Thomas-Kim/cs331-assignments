  $FindLocalMinimum(G)$
  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
    \STATE Define $quad(v)$ to be (the set of vertices in the same quadrant of $G$ as $v$) unioned with (any elements of $B$ which border the previous set).
    \STATE Let $B, C, T, TC$ be defined on $G$ as specified in the problem.
    \STATE $minVert \leftarrow min_{v \in S \cup T} F(v)$
    \IF {$minVert \in S \lor minVert \in TC$}
    \STATE return $minVert$
    \ELSE
    \STATE return $FindLocalMinimum(quad(minVert))$
    \ENDIF

  \noindent
  \textbf{Lemma 1}: For all such grids $G$, there exists a local minimum.
  \begin{proof}
    There are a finite number of squares each with unique weight $w_i$. \\
    Let the set $W = \{w_1, w_2, \dots, w_i\}$ \\
    By the well-ordering principle, there exists a least element of $W$. \\
    By definition, this least element is less than each of its neighbors, because it is less than every other weight in the set. \\
    Thus, it is a local (global) minimum. \\
  \end{proof}
  \noindent
  \textbf{Base case}: Note that there are no bases cases by lemma 1. \\
  \noindent
  \textbf{Proof of correctness}:
  \begin{proof}
      Suppose there is no local minimum when $S' \cup T' = G'$, where $G'$ is the subgrid in the final iteration. \\
      Take $v_c$ to be the center vertex of $G'$. \\
      Note that in the previous iteration, $v_c$ must have been in $T$, since it couldn't have been in $S \cup TC$ and $S' \cup T' = G'$
      This means $v_c$ is the smallest element in $G'$ \\
      This means $v_c$ is a local minimum. \\
  \end{proof}
  \noindent
  \textbf{Proof of runtime}:
  \begin{proof}
    The recurrence associated with this algorithm is $T(n) = T(\frac{n}{2}) + \theta(n)$ \\
    Expanding this recurrence, $T(n) = T(\frac{n}{4}) + c\frac{n}{2} + n$ \\
    $= \sum_{i = 1}^{n} c\frac{n}{2^i}$ \\
    Therefore the total runtime is $\theta(n)$ \\
  \end{proof}
