  {Q3}
  An opportunity cycle is one where the product of the ratios along the cycle is greater than 1.
  Give a polynomial-time algorithm to find an opportunity cycle in a graph, if one exists. \\
  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
    \STATE Let $G(V,E)$ be the graph of possible trades
    \STATE Let $w(e_i)$ be the weight of edge $e_i \in E$
    \STATE Let $G'(V', E') | V' = V$
    \FOR {$\forall e_i(u, v) \in E$}
    \STATE $e_i' = (u, v) | w(e_i') = -log(w(e_i))$
    \STATE $E' = E' \cup \{e_i'\}$
    \ENDFOR
    \FOR {$\forall v' \in V'$}
    \STATE Run Bellman-Ford on $G'$ starting on $v'$ to detect negative cycles, return TRUE if one is detected
    \ENDFOR
  \end{algorithmic}
  \noindent
  \textbf{Correctness}:
  \begin{proof}
      Suppose there is some cycle $e_1, e_2, \dots, e_k$ such that $\Pi_{i = 1}^{k}e_i > 1$
      $log\left(\Pi_{i = 1}^{k}e_i\right) > log(1)$ \\
      $\implies \sum_{i = 1}^{k} log(e_i) > 0$ \\
      $\implies \sum_{i = 1}^{k} -log(e_i) < 0$ \\
      Therefore, by line , a negative cycle corresponds to an opportunity cycle%TODO
  \end{proof}
  \textbf{Runtime}:
  \begin{proof}
      Constructing $G'$ takes $O(|V| + |E|)$ time.  \\
      Running Bellman-Ford takes $O(|V||E|)$ time.  \\
      Bellman-Ford is run $|V|$ times. \\
      Therefore, the total complexity is $O(|V|^2|E|)$ which is polynomial in the number of vertices/edges.
  \end{proof}
