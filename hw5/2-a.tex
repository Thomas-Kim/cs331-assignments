\begin{problem}
  {Q2(a)}
  Assume that you have to make change for $N$, and that you have an infinite supply of each $C = c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n$ valued coins where $1 \leq c_i \leq N-1$.
  Compute the minimum number of coins required to make the change. Provide an algorithm which solves the problem using dynamic programming, prove correctness and runtime.
  $Change(C, N)$
  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
      \STATE $C = c_1, c_2, \dots, c_k$
      \IF {$C = \{\}$}
      \RETURN $INVALID$
      \ENDIF
      \IF {$N = 0$}
      \RETURN $0$
      \ENDIF
      \RETURN $min(Change(C - \{c_k\}, N), 1 + Change(C, N-c_n))$
  \end{algorithmic}
  \noindent
  \textbf{Proof of correctness}
  \begin{proof}
  \end{proof}
  \textbf{Proof of runtime}
  \begin{proof}
      There are $n$ subsets of $C$ and $N$ values of $N$ which could be computed. \\
      We see that $Change$ could be computed $N^2$ times in the worst case, since $1 \leq c_i \leq N-1$ \\
      Therefore the worst case runtime of this algorithm is $O(N^2)$, which is polynomial in $N$. \\
  \end{proof}
