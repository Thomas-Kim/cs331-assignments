\begin{problem}
  {Q2(a)}
  Assume that you have to make change for $N$, and that you have an infinite supply of each $C = c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n$ valued coins where $1 \leq c_i \leq N-1$.
  Compute the minimum number of coins required to make the change. Provide an algorithm which solves the problem using dynamic programming, prove correctness and runtime.
