\begin{problem}
  {Q2(a)}
  Show that it is always possible to guess a number between 1 and 1 million using 20 questions.
  \begin{proof}
    Suppose we arranged the numbers into a binary tree $T$ where one node $n$'s children are given to be $n + (n / 2)$ and $n - (n / 2)$ \\
    Suppose the root of the tree is given to be $500,000$ \\
    Execute binary search on the tree $T$ \\
    The complexity of binary search is $O(log_2(n))$ \\
    $log_2(1,000,000) \leq 20 \implies $ it is possible to guess the number using 20 or more guesses. \\
  \end{proof}
