\begin{problem}
  {Q2(a)}
  Show that it is always possible to guess a number between 1 and 1 million using 20 questions.
  \begin{proof}
    Suppose the number in question is $N$.
    Suppose we arranged the numbers into a binary tree $T$ where one node $n$'s left and right children are given to be $n + (n / 2)$ and $n - (n / 2)$ respectively \\
    Suppose the root of the tree is given to be $500,000$ \\
    Execute binary search on the tree $T$, where the current node is $A$. \\
    Each question is "Is $N > A$?", and the algorithm follows the left child branch when the response is "no" and the right child when the response is "yes" \\
    The complexity of binary search is $O(log_2(n))$ \\
    $log_2(1,000,000) \leq 20 \implies $ it is possible to guess the number using 20 or more questions. \\
  \end{proof}
