  \textbf{Alice's Algorithm}
  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
    \STATE Initially $sum = 0$ and $count = 0$
    \WHILE {the input stream is not empty}
    \STATE Read the integer $i$
    \STATE Add $i$ to $sum$
    \STATE Report average as $sum / count$
    \STATE Increase $count$ by 1
    \ENDWHILE
  \end{algorithmic}
  \vspace{10pt}
  \textbf{Bob's Algorithm}
  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
    \STATE Initially $average = 0$ and $count = 0$
    \WHILE {the input stream is not empty}
    \STATE Read the integer $i$
    \STATE $average := (average \times count + i) / (count + 1)$
    \STATE Increase $count$ by 1
    \STATE $Report average$
    \ENDWHILE
  \end{algorithmic}
  \textbf{Solution:}\\
  \noindent
  Alice's algorithm is incorrect
  \begin{proof}
      Suppose the set of numbers taken as input to Alice's algorithm $S=\{1\}$ \\
      By line 5 of Alice's algorithm, $count=0,sum=1,\frac{sum}{count} = \frac{1}{0}$. \\
      The answer is undefined when it should be 1. \\
  \end{proof}
  \noindent
  Bob's algorithm is correct
  \begin{proof}
      Let $Average(S_n)$ be defined as the mean of the subset of $S$ containing the first $n$ elements. \\
      Let $S_n$ be defined as the $n$th element of the set $S$.
      Let $S$ be a set of $N$ integers. \\
      By the definition of mean of set S, $Average(S_N) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} S_i}{N}$. \\
      \textbf{Base case:} \\
      $Average(S_1) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{1} S_i}{1} = S_1$ \\
      By line 4 of Bob's algorithm, $Average(S_1) = 0 \times 0 + S_1 / (0 + 1) = S_1$ \\
      By simple observation, Bob's algorithm is correct when computing the average of a set consisting of 1 number. \\
      \textbf{Induction hypothesis:} \\
      By line 4 of Bob's algorithm, $Average(S_{n+1}) = Average(S_n) * count + i) / (count + 1)$ \\
      By line 5 of Bob's algorithm, when processing integer $S_{n+1}$, $count = n$ \\
      $Average(S_{n+1}) = (Average(S_n) * n) + i) / (n+1)$ \\
      $Average(S_{n+1}) = (\frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{n} S_i}{n} * n + S_{n+1}) / (n+1)$ \\
      $Average(S_{n+1}) = ((\sum_{i = 1}^{n} S_i) + S_{n+1}) / (n + 1)$ \\
      \{$((\sum_{i = 1}^{n} S_i) + S_{n+1}) = (\sum_{i = 1}^{n+1} S_i)\}$ \\
      $Average(S_{n+1}) = (\sum_{i = 1}^{n+1} S_i) / (n + 1) $ \\
  \end{proof}
