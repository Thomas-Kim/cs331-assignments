\begin{problem}
  {Q1(b)}
  State whether Alice or Bob have provided correct algorithms.
  Also, either prove the algorithm to be right, or show how it is wrong.\\
  The algorithms in question have been reproduced below with numbered lines for convenience: \\
  \vspace{10pt}\\
  \textbf{Alice's Algorithm}
  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
    \STATE Initially $sum = 0$ and $count = 0$
    \WHILE {the input stream is not empty}
    \STATE Read the integer $i$
    \STATE Add $i$ to $sum$
    \STATE Report average as $sum / count$
    \STATE Increase $count$ by 1
    \ENDWHILE
  \end{algorithmic}
  \vspace{10pt}
  \textbf{Bob's Algorithm}
  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
    \STATE Initially $average = 0$ and $count = 0$
    \WHILE {the input stream is not empty}
    \STATE Read the integer $i$
    \STATE $average := (average \times count + i) / (count + 1)$
    \STATE Increase $count$ by 1
    \STATE $Report average$
    \ENDWHILE
  \end{algorithmic}
  \textbf{Solution:}\\
