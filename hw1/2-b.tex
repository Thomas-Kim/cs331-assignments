  {Q2(a)}
  Show that it possible to guess a number 1-N given 3 "strikes" (questions answered no) and $O(n^{\frac{1}{3}})$ questions. \\
  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
    \STATE Phase 1: $g_1 = 0$, Guessing number $1 < n < N$
    \FOR {$g_1 = 0 \dots N^{\frac{1}{3}}$}
    \STATE Ask "Is $ n^{\frac{1}{3}} > g_1$?"
    \IF {Answer = "No"}
    \STATE Save the current value of $g_1$ and go to Phase 2
    \ENDIF
    \ENDFOR
    \STATE Phase 2: $g_2 = 0$
    \STATE Define a mapping $f(x) \rightarrow x - g_1$
    \FOR {$g_2 = 0 \dots ((g_1)^3 - (g_1 - 1)^3)$}
    \STATE Ask "Is $(f(n))^{\frac{1}{3}} < g_2$?"
    \IF {Answer = "No"}
    \STATE Save the current value of $g_2$ and go to Phase 3
    \ENDIF
    \ENDFOR
    \STATE Phase 3: $g_3 = 0$
    \FOR {$g_3 = 0 \dots (f^{-1}((g_2)^3) - f^{-1}((g_2 - 1)^3)$}
    \STATE Ask "Is $n > g_3$?"
    \IF {Answer = "No"}
    \STATE Guess $g_3$ and halt
    \ENDIF
    \ENDFOR

  \textbf{Lemma 1:} At the beginning of phase 2, $N^{\frac{1}{3}}$ questions, $1$ strike will be used. \\
  \begin{proof}
  \end{proof}
  \textbf{Lemma 2:} Let $\alpha = N^{\frac{1}{3}}$. At the beginning of phase 2, the possible values of $n$ will be bounded by $(\alpha - 1)^3 \leq n \leq (\alpha)^3$ \\
  \begin{proof}
  \end{proof}
  \textbf{Lemma 3:} At the beginning of phase 3, $N^{\frac{1}{3}} + (3\alpha^2 - 3\alpha + 1)^{\frac{1}{3}}$ questions, $2$ strikes will be used. \\
  \begin{proof}
  \end{proof}
  \textbf{Lemma 4:} Let $\beta = N^{\frac{1}{3}}$. At the beginning of phase 3, the possible values of $n$ will be bounded by $(\beta - 1)^3 \leq n \leq (\beta)^3$ \\
  \begin{proof}
  \end{proof}
  \textbf{Proof of correctness:}
  \begin{proof}
  By \textbf{Lemma 4}, the possible values of $n$ are bounded by $(\beta - 1)^3 \leq n \leq (\beta)^3$. \\
  By line TODO! of the algorithm, Phase 3 is a linear search over this range
  By \textbf{Lemma 5}, $g_3 - 1 < n \land n \leq g_3 \implies n = g_3$
  By line TODO! of the algorithm, the value guessed is $g_3 = n$.
  \end{proof}
  \textbf{Proof of termination within $O(N^{\frac{1}{3}})$ time:}
  \begin{proof}
  \end{proof}
  \textbf{Proof of termination using precisely 3 strikes:}
  \begin{proof}
    By \textbf{Lemma 3}, At the beginning of phase 3, $2$ strikes have been used up. \\
    By line TODO! of the algorithm, after receiving the $3^{rd}$ strike, the algorithm will halt. \\
  \end{proof}
