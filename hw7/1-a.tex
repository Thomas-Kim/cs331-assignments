\begin{problem}
  {Q1(a)}
  \textbf{Prove or disprove} \\
  Claim: Consider an implementation of Ford-Fulkerson algorithm which does not create any backward edges in the residual graph. It is claimed that, there exists a constant $\alpha > 0$, such
  that for any flow network $G$, this modified implementation is guaranteed to find a flow of value at least $\alpha$ times the maximum-flow value in $G$
