\begin{problem}
  {Q2}
  Let $s$ be the vertex of a connected undirected graph $G$. Let $T_{G,s}^{B}$ and $T_{G,s}^{D}$ respectively
  be the trees obtained by running BFS and DFS on graph $G$ starting at node $s$. Prove
  \begin{align*}
    T_{G,s}^{B} \equiv T_{G,s}^{D} \implies G \text{ is acyclic}
  \end{align*}
