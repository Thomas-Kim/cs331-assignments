\begin{problem}
  {Q3}
  Given $n$ images and $m$ unambiguous matches, design an algorithm that runs in $O(m+n)$ time and
  uniquely labels $n$ images as either A or B, such that two images reported to be the same by
  ImgComp get the same label, and two images reported to be different by ImgComp get different labels. \\
  Prove the algorithm's runtime and correctness. \\
