  {Q5}
  Consider a set of mobile computing clients in a certain town who each need to be connected to one of several possible \textit{base stations}.
  We'll suppose there are $n$ clients, with the position of each client specified by its $(x,y)$ coordinates in the plane. There are also $k$ base stations; the positions
  of each of these is specified by $(x,y)$ coordinates as well. For each client, we wish to connect it to exactly one of the base stations. Our
  choice of connections is constrained in the following ways.\\
  \begin{itemize}
  \item There is a \textit{range parameter} $r$ - a client can only be connected to a base station that is within distance $r$.
  \item There is also a \textit{load parameter} $L$ - no more than $L$ clients can be connected to any single base station.
  \end{itemize}
  Your goal is to design a polynomial-time algorithm for the following problem. Given the positions of a set of clients and a set of base stations, as well as the range and load parameters, decide
  whether every client can be connected simultaneously to a base station, subject to the range and load conditions in the previous paragraph.
\end{problem}
