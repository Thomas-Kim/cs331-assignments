\begin{problem}
  {Q2}
  Given positive integers n and W, design a dynamic programming algorithm that finds
  the number of possible n element sets $\{x_1, \dots , x_n\}$ for which $\sum_i x_i^2 = W$ where each
  $x_i$ is a nonnegative integer.
  \noindent
  \textbf{Memoization}
  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
    \STATE Create an $n$ by $W$ table
    \STATE Each element $(j, k)$ of the table will hold the number of unique $j$ element sets for which $\sum_i x_i^2 = k$
  \end{algorithmic}
  \textbf{Algorithm}
  $OPT(i, j, k)$
  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
    \IF {$j = 0 \land k = 0$}
    \RETURN 1
    \ELSIF {$i = 0 \lor j < 0 \lor k < 0$}
    \RETURN 0
    \ENDIF
    \RETURN $OPT(i-1, j-1, k-i^2) + OPT(i-1, j, k)$
  \end{algorithmic}
  Call $OPT(0, n, W)$ \\
  \textbf{Correctness}
  \begin{proof}
    For each value of $i$, a value $i^2$ can either be used or not used. \\
    Both are explored by line 6 of the algorithm \\
    Therefore the entire solution space is explored. \\
    Solutions requiring more or fewer than $n$ elements are discarded by line 3 \\
    Solutions which require precisely $n$ elements are accepted by line 1 \\
  \end{proof}
  \noindent
  \textbf{Runtime}
  \begin{proof}
      At worst, the entire table is filled. \\
      The table has $nW$ elements \\
      Therefore, the algorithm is pseudopolynomial in $n$ \\
  \end{proof}
