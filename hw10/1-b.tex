\begin{problem}
    {Q1(b)}
    Claim: Independent Set $\leq_p$ Interval Scheduling \\
    \begin{proof}
        Independent Set is NP-Complete. \\
        Therefore, Independent Set is in NP \\
        By the problem statement, Interval Scheduling is NP-Complete \\
        Therefore, all problems in NP can be reduced to Interval Scheduling in polynomial time. \\
        Therefore, Independent Set $\leq_p$ Interval Scheduling \\
    \end{proof}
