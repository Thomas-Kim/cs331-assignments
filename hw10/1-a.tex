    {Q1(a)}
    Given a collection of intervals on a time-line, and a bound $k$, does the collection contain a subset of nonoverlapping intervals of size at least $k$? \\
    Claim: Interval Scheduling $\leq_p$ Vertex Cover \\
    \textbf{True} \\
    \begin{proof}
        Vertex Cover is NP-Complete \\
        Interval Scheduling is NP-Complete by the problem statement. \\
        Therefore, Interval Scheduling is in NP. \\
        All problems in NP are reducible to any NP-Complete problem. \\
        Therefore, Interval Scheduling $\leq_p$ Vertex Cover. \\
        %Therefore every problem in NP is reducible to Vertex Cover \\
        %Now, suppose the certificate for Interval Scheduling is a subset of intervals \\
        %One can easily check whether this subset is nonoverlapping and of size at least $k$ in polynomial time
        %by first adding the intervals and comparing to $k$ ($O(n)$ time), then sorting the intervals by start time and
        %ensuring interval $i+1$ does not overlap with interval $i$ ($O(n)$ time). \\
        %% TODO: rigorous proof of the second part?
