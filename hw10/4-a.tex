\begin{problem}
    {Q4(a)}
    Given $n$ containers of weight $w_1, \dots, w_n$, trucks of capacity $K$, minimize the number of trucks to carry all the weight. This problem is NP-Complete. \\
    Greedy Algorithm: Start with an empty truck, then begin piling containers $1, 2, 3, \dots$ until you get to a container which would overflow the weight limit. \\
    Now declare this truck "loaded" and send it off; then continue the process with a fresh truck. \\
    Given an example of a set of weights, a value of $K$, where this algorithm does not use the minimum possible number of trucks. \\
\end{problem}
