    {Q1(b)}
    $T-SAT$: All variables appear in non-negated form only \\
    Prove or disprove: $T-SAT$ is NP-Complete \\
    \textbf{Claim}: $T-SAT$ is not NP-Complete \\
    \textbf{T-SAT Algorithm}
    \begin{algorithmic}[1]
        \RETURN 1
    \end{algorithmic}
    \noindent
    \textbf{Proof of correctness}:
    \begin{proof}
        Let all variables be assigned T \\
        Each clause is of the form $(x_1 \lor x_2 \lor \dots \lor x_k)$ \\
        When every variable is assigned T, this reduces to: \\
        $(T \lor T \lor \dots \lor T)$ \\
        So every clause evaluates True. \\
        Now $\Phi = C_1 \land C_2 \land \dots \land C_n$ \\
        Since every clause is True, this becomes: \\
        $\Phi = T \land T \land T \dots \land T$ \\
        This trivially evaluates to True. \\
        Therefore, every T-SAT expression is satisfiable. \\
        The algorithm returns $1$ by line 1, so it is correct. \\
    \end{proof}
    \noindent
    \textbf{Proof of runtime}:
    \begin{proof}
        The runtime is constant, since there is only 1 line and it is a return statement \\
    \end{proof}
